# Contributing guidelines

## Before contributing

Welcome to [GDSC-KNUST/GDSC-Solves-Project-Euler](https://github.com/GDSC-KNUST/GDSC-Solves-Project-Euler)! Before sending your pull requests, make sure that you __read the whole guidelines__. If you have any doubt on the contributing guide, please feel free to [state it clearly in an issue](https://github.com/GDSC-KNUST/GDSC-Solves-Project-Euler/issues/new) or ask the community in our Discord Server or WhatsApp groups.

## Contributing

### Contributor

We are very happy that you are considering implementing algorithms and data structures for others! This repository is referenced and used by learners from all over the globe. Being one of our contributors, you agree and confirm that:

- You did your work - no plagiarism allowed
  - Any plagiarized work will not be merged.
- Your work will be distributed under [Creative Commons Legal Code](LICENSE.md) once your pull request is merged
- Your submitted work fulfils or mostly fulfils our styles and standards

__New implementation__ is welcome! For example, new solutions for a problem, different representations for a graph data structure or algorithm designs with different complexity but __identical implementation__ of an existing implementation is not allowed. Please check whether the solution is already implemented or not before submitting your pull request.

__Improving comments__ and __writing proper tests__ are also highly welcome.

### Contribution

We appreciate any contribution, from fixing a grammar mistake in a comment to implementing complex algorithms. Please read this section if you are contributing your work.

Since we will not be running automated testing on this repo. We advice you add tests to your program or make it runs correctly since it is going to be read and used by other members for other activities.

Please help us keep our issue list small by adding fixes: #{$ISSUE_NO} to the commit message of pull requests that resolve open issues. GitHub will use this tag to auto-close the issue when the PR is merged.

#### TODO

An Algorithm is one or more functions (or classes) that:

- take one or more inputs,
- perform some internal calculations or data manipulations,
- return one or more outputs,
- have minimal side effects (Ex. `print()`, `plot()`, `read()`, `write()`).

Algorithms should be packaged in a way that would make it easy for readers to put them into larger programs.

Algorithms should:

- have intuitive class and function names that make their purpose clear to readers
- use native language naming conventions and intuitive variable names to ease comprehension. eg; `Python` function names should be in snake_case whiles languages like `Java` could have Pascal casing for function names and variables.
- be flexible to take different input values
- have Python type hints for their input parameters and return values
- have docstrings with clear explanations and/or URLs to source materials
- make sure to add `tests` if you can to the code snippet you submit.
- make sure your solutions should have passed all the necessary tests on the website before submissions are done.

#### Other Requirements for Submissions

- Just enjoy yourself while during this!

### Note

- Most importantly,
  - __Be consistent in the use of these guidelines when submitting.__
  - __Join__ us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dzea8JNWGE) __now!__
  - Happy coding!
